Architecture of Agent
------------------------
The Agent has three main parts: the collector, DogStatsD, and the forwarder:

Collector: It runs checks on the current machine for configured integrations, and captures system metrics, such as memory and CPU.

DogStatsD: It is a StatsD-compatible backend server that you can send custom metrics to from your applications.

Forwarder: It retrieves data from both DogStatsD and the collector, queues it up, and then sends it to Datadog.
